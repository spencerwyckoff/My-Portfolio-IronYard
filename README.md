#Spencer Wyckoff's Portfolio
######My front end engineering portfolio created throughout the course between January 3 - March 27, 2015.


##HTML/CSS/JavaScript Projects

####[The Farmer's Market](http://development.farmersmarket.divshot.io/#/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/TheFarmersMarket/FrontEnd)
The Farmer's Market is my final group project, and it was created to simplify farm-to-table commerce between farmers and consumers.  It's a completely responsive application, built on Materialize's Grid framework, and uses Angular as the MV framework.  Personally, I was responsible for all of the front end functionality and design, and I had the help of two Rails engineers creating the api.

#####Resources Used
- Angular.js 
- Materialize.css
- Sass
- jQuery
- HTML
- Lightbox (image styling)
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This project was an outstanding deep dive into the world of Angular and learning how to build an application from scratch using multiple templates, controllers, factories, and routes.  I also got very clear and proficient with setting items to scope, accessing them on the DOM, and using ng-repeat to populate search listings.  

====================================================================================================================
####[Genius Sports](http://development.geniussports.divshot.io/#/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/Geniussports/Frontend)
Genius Sports is a hackathon project, in fact my very first hackathon project.  The goal was to create an application that would help recreational sports team manage their players, parents, schedule, and contact info.  I was responsible for all of the front end and I worked with a team of three guys who built an api with Rails.

#####Resources Used
- Angular.js 
- Foundation.css
- Sass
- jQuery
- HTML
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This project made me realize how powerful Angular is for creating projects from scratch, fast.  I gained a lot of experience in creating a user authenticated site, working with Angular's $routes, and making api calls with a backend team.  We eneded up winning best presentation for our project and was an overall fantastic first hackathon.

====================================================================================================================
####[My Morning Routine App](http://development.assignment19-crud.divshot.io/#/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/MorningRoutineApp)
My Morning Routine app is my first go at a CRUD application.  I have a personal interest in creating morning routines and wanted to build an application that would empower others to do the same.  

#####Resources Used
- Angular.js 
- Foundation.css
- Sass
- jQuery
- Underscore
- HTML
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This is my first project using Angular.js - so it was a learning experience and definitely incomplete.  I learned how to setup an Angular application from nothing, setup $routes, route to different templates, setup my factories and controllers, and make api calls to a Parse database.    

====================================================================================================================
####[Five Die (a dice game)](http://development.sw-five-die.divshot.io/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/FiveDie)
Five Die - a simple, yet surprisingly addictive, dice game - is a 1 player game of chance and light strategy.  A player starts with 5 dice and rolls them to get the lowest possible score. It is also my first ever game programmed completely with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

#####Resources Used
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This project was my first HUGE win with programming.  I shared the game with my blog, friends, and family and got incredible reviews from everyone.  It took me a long time to get the turns working the way I wanted it to, but was a great lesson and a lot of fun to create overall.

====================================================================================================================
####[Alaydi's Cafe](http://development.bholben-divshot.divshot.io) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/Alaydis-Cafe)
This was a group project where we had to create a website for a client who owned a restaurant.  They had certain requirements and deliverables that they wanted for their site including having an updatable menu . We pulled down data used on the site via their API.

#####Resources Used
- HTML
- Instagram API
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Underscore
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This was the very first group project we did as a class.  We colalborated on a design, layout, and functionality to deliver.  Next, we divided up the project into a series of modules and split them up.  I created the overall look of the site, created the menu animation, and created the JSON data file we were pulling from.  This project really opened my eyes to the navigation and structure of datasets and how to populate web pages with real data in real time.

====================================================================================================================
####[Recreate My GitHub](http://development.sw-github-recreate.divshot.io/) - [gh-repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/GitHub-Recreate)
Project to re-create my own GitHub page using the GitHub API - striving for pixel perfection.

#####Resources Used
- Underscore
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bourbon/Neat
- NPM
- Bower
- Gulp
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This was my first exercise looping through arrays of data, in this case our GH repos using the GH api.  Once I had the data I needed, I needed to create HTML templates using Handlebars to display it onto the page in the appropriate places.  It was really eye opening to see how an API is created and how to navigate through it - it became much simpler to understand once I saw behind the curtain a bit.

====================================================================================================================
####[Etsy Page](http://development.sw-etsy-page.divshot.io/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/Create-Etsy-Page)
Project to re-create an Etsy search page and work with the Etsy API.

#####Resources Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- NPM
- Bower
- Gulp
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This was a really fun exercise.  Having a love for the Atlanta braves, I decided to make my Etsy page tailor towards Atlanta Braves products.  I had to use the Etsy API to gather my search results and then had to construct a template to display the information in each product like the name, seller, and pricing.  All the other elements on the page were created with pixel perfection in mind and I'm very happy with the way it turned out.

====================================================================================================================
####[Accordion](https://spencerwyckoff.github.io/accordion/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/accordion)
Create an accordion layout from scratch using jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

#####Resources Used
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- gh-pages

#####Takeaways
This project got me to better understand how to manipulate the state of the DOM using jQuery and specifically manipulating HTML element's classes using jQuery.  It also opened up my eyes to CSS elements like hovering, clicking, and transitions.

====================================================================================================================
####[Calcuhater](https://spencerwyckoff.github.io/JS-Calculator/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/JS-Calculator)
Create a basic JavaScript calculator that can calculate basic functions.

#####Resources Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- gh-pages

#####Takeaways
This project was our introduction to basic vanilla JavaScript.  Up to this point we had only worked in HTML and CSS.  I learned a lot about how to create a basic function, how to pass arguments into those functions, and how to create different methods within a calculator object.  Looking back on it now, it's something I definitely would like to improve upon given the time.

====================================================================================================================
##Basic Layout - HTML/CSS Exercises

####[Surf & Paddle](https://spencerwyckoff.github.io/Surf-Paddle/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/Surf-Paddle)
This was a pixel perfect exercise where we were given [this image](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/Surf-Paddle/blob/master/image_archives/surf-paddle.png), and then had to recreate it from scratch using only HTML and CSS.

#####Resources Used
- HTML
- CSS
- gh-pages

#####Takeaways
This was my second project using HTML and CSS - so it was less of a struggle than Octocats - however it still came with plenty of CSS brick walls.  That being said, I kept powering through it little by little and created a final product that I'm proud of.  The method I used to achieve pixel perfection was constantly making adjustments in the Chrome "Inspect Element" tools - modifying the spacing and sizing of things locally there and reapplying those changes to my code.

====================================================================================================================

####[Octocats](https://spencerwyckoff.github.io/Octocats/) - [gh repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/Octocats)
This was a CSS pixel perfect exercise where we were given a giant mess of HTML elements and had to make them look like [this image](https://github.com/tiy-atl-js-q1-2015/Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%2002/octodex.png).

#####Resources Used
- CSS
- gh-pages

#####Takeaways
This was my 1st assignment, and it was simply using CSS to restructure the image provide.  This, being the first assingment, came with plenty of brick walls - however I kept at it and was able to create something at the very least... not too proud of it, however I've learned so much since this first assignment 3 months ago.  If you're looking at this and thinking no way to this guy - just look at the progression of my code from what you see in [The Farmer's Market](https://github.com/TheFarmersMarket/FrontEnd).
