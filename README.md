##HTML/CSS/JavaScript Projects

[The Farmer's Market](http://development.farmersmarket.divshot.io/#/) - [GH Repo](https://github.com/TheFarmersMarket/FrontEnd)
The Farmer's Market is our final group project, and it was created to simplify farm-to-table commerce between farmers and consumers.  It's a completely responsive application, built on Materialize's Grid framework, and uses Angular as the MV framework.  Personally, I was responsible for all of the front end functionality and design, and I had the help of two Rails engineers creating the api.

**Resources Used**
- Angular.js 
- Materialize.css
- jQuery
- Lightbox (image styling)

**Takeaways**
This project was an outstanding deep dive into the world of Angular and learning how to build an application from scratch using multiple templates, controllers, factories, and routes.  I also got very clear and proficient with setting items to scope, accessing them on the DOM, and using ng-repeat to populate search listings.
