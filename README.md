# My Iron Yard Experience
My front end engineering portfolio created throughout the course between January 3 - March 27, 2015.

##HTML/CSS/JavaScript Projects


####[The Farmer's Market](http://development.farmersmarket.divshot.io/#/) - [GH Repo](https://github.com/TheFarmersMarket/FrontEnd)
The Farmer's Market is our final group project, and it was created to simplify farm-to-table commerce between farmers and consumers.  It's a completely responsive application, built on Materialize's Grid framework, and uses Angular as the MV framework.  Personally, I was responsible for all of the front end functionality and design, and I had the help of two Rails engineers creating the api.

#####Resources Used
- Angular.js 
- Materialize.css
- Sass
- jQuery
- Lightbox (image styling)
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This project was an outstanding deep dive into the world of Angular and learning how to build an application from scratch using multiple templates, controllers, factories, and routes.  I also got very clear and proficient with setting items to scope, accessing them on the DOM, and using ng-repeat to populate search listings.  


####[Genius Sports](http://development.geniussports.divshot.io/#/) - [GH Repo](https://github.com/Geniussports/Frontend)
Genius Sports is a hackathon project, in fact my very first hackathon project.  The goal was to create an application that would help recreational sports team manage their players, parents, schedule, and contact info.  I was responsible for all of the front end and I worked with a team of three guys who built an api with Rails.

#####Resources Used
- Angular.js 
- Foundation.css
- Sass
- jQuery
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This project made me realize how powerful Angular is for creating projects from scratch, fast.  I gained a lot of experience in creating a user authenticated site, working with Angular's $routes, and making api calls with a backend team.  We eneded up winning best presentation for our project and was an overall fantastic first hackathon.

####[My Morning Routine App](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/MorningRoutineApp) - [GH Repo](https://github.com/spencerwyckoff/MorningRoutineApp)
My Morning Routine app is my first go at a CRUD application.  I have a personal interest in creating morning routines and wanted to build an application that would empower others to do the same.  

#####Resources Used
- Angular.js 
- Foundation.css
- Sass
- jQuery
- Underscore
- Gulp
- NPM
- Bower 
- Yeoman

#####Takeaways
This is my first project using Angular.js - so it was a learning experience and definitely incomplete.  I learned how to setup an Angular application from nothing, setup $routes, route to different templates, setup my factories and controllers, and make api calls to a Parse database.
